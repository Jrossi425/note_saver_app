# Note-Saver-App https://img.shields.io/badge/lisence-MIT-red
  
## Description
Week 11 challenge to modify starter code to create an application called Note Taker that can be used to write, save and delete notes. When the user opens the app, they are taken to the Note Taker landing page with a link to a notes page. When the user clicks on the link to the notes page, they are then presented with a page with existing notes listed in the left-hand column, plus empty fields to enter a new note title and the note's text in the right-hand column. When the user enters a new note title and the note's text, then a save icon appears in the navigation at the top of the page. The user can click this icon and have the new note entered and saved in the left-hand column with the other existing notes. When the user clicks on an existing note in the left-hand column, then the note appears in the right-hand column. When the user clicks on the write icon in the navigation at the top of the page, they are presented with empty fields to enter a new note title and the note's text in the right-hand column. When the user clicks the delete icon in the left-hand column, they then remove that saved note from the left-hand column.
